      by Ted R Bailey</p>
      <br />
   <p><h3>The marines had lined the perimeter of the tube at Port 18, blasters ready.
       "Snake, hit it with a Sounder," Cobra thought-commanded over the 
       SubD comm link, which required thought only, no audible voice was
       needed on the SubD.</h3></p>
      
     
      <p><h3>Suddenly, a large robot burst through the doorway of the airlock and started 
      blasting with a laser weapon of some sort. The Cobras returned fire as the Blasters 
      ripped at the metallic plating of the armored robot soldier.</h3></p>
     
      <p><h3>The robot soldier flipped sideways to the left, spun counter-clockwise like a 
      giant metallic ballerina and blew into two pieces, the top half was split in half 
      and fell to either side, while the legs clumped into a metal pile of junk on the 
      floor going forward a few feet from the top pieces. Its laser weapon fell to the 
      floor and slid down the floor toward Cobra until coming to a stop, directly 
      dead-center between the two lines of defending Cobras.</h3></p>

      <h2>Silence of the Darkness</h2>
      by Ted R Bailey</p>
      <br />
      <p><h3>     The silence of the darkness shouted at my soul. My heart exploded as the sins of my past weighed heavily upon me. Steam rose from the street as it began to rain. Only, it never rains in Houston.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>    It floods.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>Like my moods.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>Maybe the rain is God’s way of trying to wash away my sins, both physically and mentally. And it didn’t help to be walking in it. My luck was showing its big bad self again; my car had just broken down two blocks back. This natural
            baptism merely resulted in drenching my trench coat and the bottom of my pants.  The pain and the memories remained.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>The tiny bullets of rain hitting my hat quickly became a machine gun.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>I was relieved to finally be reaching paradise and the only salvation I’d 
            ever known, The Railhead Icehouse, when, speak of the devil, there was Janet
            standing next to the bar with her arms crossed defiantly across her voluptuous
            chest, looking straight at me with those eyes that spoke louder than her screaming at me.</h3></p>
      <hr />
      <br />
      <p><h3>Pussy Willow</h3></p>
     
      <p><h3>Sitting before me was one of the sexiest, most beautiful Chinese women I had ever
             seen in my life. She was wearing, or should I say almost wearing, a very sexy
             whiter-than-white, silk evening gown. It was low cut on the top, revealing voluptuous, round breasts and followed every curve downward to her ankles, with a slit that went all the way up to heaven.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>Her every movement radiated sexuality as she crossed her right leg over the left leg,
             and the long dress fell to either side of the slowly curving smoothness to white 
             stiletto-sharp high-heel shoes, one of which was swinging on the end of her toes
             as it dangled off her foot sexily.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>A silver anklet delicately formed a single, thin line around her leg just above the ankle.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>My heart was a rock and roll drum set.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>Her solid black hair was immaculately styled in a twist up on her head except for two long strands of softly curled hair, spiraling down past the long silver earrings to tickle her breasts. A tasteful choker of solid white pearls hung gracefully around her long neck.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>I let my eyes retrace her body up her silky-smooth legs, back past the voluptuous breasts, skimming her neckline, until I finally saw them: the eyes.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>She entranced me with her perfectly shaped, large Chinese, dazzling green eyes that were locked into mine with a grip that wouldn’t let go.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>I didn’t mind.</h3></p>
      <p><h3>“My name is Pussy,” she almost whispered. “Pussy Willow.” It was the sexiest voice I had ever heard. She twirled her finger around one of the draping curls as she said it. “Your mouth is open, Mr. Spike.”</h3></p>
      <p><h3>I shut it.</h3></p>
