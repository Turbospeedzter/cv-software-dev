            <h1>Who Is Ted Bailey?</h1>
      <p>Let me introduce myself.  I am a techie, a nerd, a writer, and broadcaster.  If it seems unusual for technical person to also be a writer, you are right.  Somehow, I landed on the fence between both types of people, and I am proud of it.</p>
      <p>All my life, from junior high school, teachers told me I was a good speaker and an excellent writer.  My mother had been an English teacher in her young college days, but threw out a caveat about writing.  "Don't try to make a living at writing but continue to build your skill and use it in whatever field you choose to be in." As a whole, I followed that advice, unless being a broadcast journalist breaks the rule.</p>
      <p>Basically, I was a science nut, an airplane nut, a science-fiction nut, and a physics nut. At eighteen, I got interested in radio.  I was fascinated at how a radio works.  How is it I can tune a two-way radio in the little room under the stairwell and hear Russia, China, Cuba, Japan, and everyone else. How does that magic work?</p>
      <p>I enrolled in Elkins Institute of Broadcasting and within nine months, I had passed the FCC First Class License Exam from the Broadcast Engineering course I took.  I was only eighteen. Then, there was broadcasting and journalism.  I loved journalism. I took to it like Wheat Thins does to Philadelphia Cream Cheese.</p>
      <p>Immediately, I was hired by KDAV Radio in Lubbock, Texas as a news man, all-round announcer and pretty much the week-end guy.  Seriously, the week-end guy.  I did everything from my own show to engineering, to news reporting.  They already had someone to clean the toilets.</p>
      <p>Next, was the Air Force where I became a Ground Radio Electronic Tech. I was damn good at it. They sent me back to college to complete my degree, a BBA in Business and Marketing.</p>
      <p>Later,I taught college in China, had my own radio show in Shanghai, got famous with the young people, and married the TV producer.  Oh,yeah, I wrote a lot of magazine articles.</p>
      <p>Now, I am a computer programmer and writer of scifi stories and novels. I code websites and mobile apps as well.  Somehow, I have managed to play around all my life.</p>
      <p>  My wife makes that quite clear to me.</p>
      <p>Oh, yeah.  Isn't the name Ted R Bailey incorrect grammar?  It should be Ted Is Bailey, right? I'll shut up now.</p>
